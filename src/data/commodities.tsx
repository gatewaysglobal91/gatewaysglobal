            The Meat, Poultry & Seafood commodity covers live animals, fresh /
            frozen meat, seafood, processed forms, and by-products. It falls
            under HS Chapters 01, 02, 03, 16, etc., depending on product form
            (fresh, frozen, processed). Export quality requires adherence to
            Codex, HACCP, GMP, food safety and veterinary standards. Inspection,
            testing (microbial, residue, sensory) and third-party certification
            are essential. Packaging must maintain the cold chain; transport via
            reefer containers or temperature-controlled air. End markets include
            retail, foodservice, processed foods, pet food, and specialty
            segments. Key challenges: sanitary protocols, residue compliance,
            logistics, shelf life, and regulatory barriers.
